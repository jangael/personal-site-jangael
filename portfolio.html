      <h4>July 9, 2020</h4>
      <p class="p.port">
      This project is based on the Buzzfeed Style Personality Quizes. We learned the basic of Javascript by using flow charts to plan our program flow and learned the use of variables in
      terms of Computer Science. We also learned how to define necessary variables needed for a personality quiz by using DOM. We then also learned to link HTML, CSS, and Javascript to put
      together our personality quiz. I decided to do my personality quiz on what pillow pet you are by what outfit you planned based on two things: 1) I really want a pillow pet right now.
      My mom stored away my cubs pillow pet, which is somewhere in the house, but I realllly want a milkshake cow pillow pet. Those are out of stock right now because they're really popular
      at the moment. 2) I really like fashion. I'm that person who owns so many clothes but I would be like "I have nothing to wear!" What I wear is one of the many ways I express myself. How I dress
      determines how I feel that day. I usually spend a long time planning my outfits--but I always pay attention to the big and little pieces of my outfit--which is why I also spent a lot of time
        focusing on the deatils of this website. Overall, I loved how this project turned out! Take the quiz for yourself and find out what pillow pet you are (Also I'm not associated with pillow
        pets in any way).

      <h4>July 16, 2020</h4>
      <p class="p.port">
      This website highlights the importance of mental health and the economic and social barriers different ethnic groups face trying to reach out to
      those services. We continue to use incoperate HTML, CSS, and Javascript into a multi-tab website in order to spread awareness to a topic we care about. 
      I chose to talk about mental health because growing up, I grew up in an enviroment where mental health is seen as taboo. Sometimes, I feel like I can't 
      comfortably talk about how I feel when I'm facing issues. I want to spread awareness to break down the misconceptions of mental health and help connect and educate more people
      to resources of mental health. If I had more time, I would've implemented more media and interactivity into the website so it's easy to navigate. I would also like to spend more
      time trying to figure out the flexboxxing of the website because I'm still confused about it.
