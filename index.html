      Hello! My name is Jangael and I'm a 17 years old Filipina girl, born and raised in Chicago IL. I currently go to Von Steuben Metropolitan Science Center in 
      Albany Park. This website is going to display my projects I worked on during my time in the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/programs/summer-immersion-program">Girls Who Code's SIP 2020</a>. 
      This website will be evident proof of my growing and learning process of exploring my interests in Computer Science, which include
      Web Design, Data Scientist, and Coding; I recently explored Cybersecurity but GWC is going to help me expand and express my knowledge of coding. 
      I hope to go into a career into Computer Science and work for a tech company, meanwhile
      diversifying STEM fields by educating children my age. If not, I would also like to be a Child Psychologist and educate the importance of mental health, 
      especially for POC. Either way, I want to make a positive impact through the work I do and hopefully inspire others to do the same :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      My other intersts unrelated to Computer Science include: Psychology, 
      Photography, and Graphic Design. Other than academic interests, I love being with my friends, baking, cooking, sleeping, singing, play minecraft, styling outfits, scroll through the internet,
      and have a good time.
    </p>

      Other than Computer Science, I have been involved in many extracurriculars over the years. I'm in my school's <a href ="https://twitter.com/vonmath?lang=en">math team</a> as a starter for CCML and ICTM; I earned awards for solo and team competitions.
      I'm involved in the <a href="https://twitter.com/VonSteubenArts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Eprofile%3AVonSteubenArts&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vonarts.org%2F">arts</a>: I have been in the school's choir as a soprano and the school's drama
      program; I earned awards for choir competitions (solo and ensemble) and I was scheduled as Crystal for Little Shop of Horrors (2020) and played Olive's Mom and Ensemble for 25th Annual Putnam
      County Spelling Bee (2019). I also do tons of community service: I volunteered for the Chicago Public Library to help with the Summer
      Learning Reading Challenge since 2016. I'm 2020-2021 NHS president and Key Club Officer for my school's chapter.
      And I'm part of <a href ="https://academy.northwestern.edu/for-chicago-public-schools/">Northwestern Academy</a> (Cohort '21). I have been told I do too much for one person, but these are all
      things I'm dedicated and passionate for over the years. 

    </p>
  
    <p>
      Follow me onto this journey, where I'm going to go through tons of self discovery as a teenage
      girl (along with blood, sweat, and tears)! Feel free to reach out to me if there are any questions, comments, or concerns
      about my projects through my email: jangael.rosales78@girlswhocode.com
